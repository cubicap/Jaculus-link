# Jaculus-link - A communication library

Jaculus-link is a standalone communication library that allows programs to communicate using virtual channels transmitted over a single
stream connection. It does not contain bindings for communication interfaces but provides a simple API for creating them.

The library also allows routing multiple stream connections to a single consumer.
