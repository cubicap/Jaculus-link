# Jaculus-link - A standalone communication library

Jaculus-link is a communication library that allows programs to communicate using virtual channels transmitted over a single
stream connection. It does not contain bindings for communication interfaces but provides a simple API for creating them.

The library also allows routing multiple multiple stream connections to a single consumer.
